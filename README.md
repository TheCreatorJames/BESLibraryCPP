# BESLibraryCPP


### Welcome
This is a port of the algorithm written in C#. This runs natively, and of course, much faster than the C# variant. More will be added to document this page, but the interface is very similar to the C# version.


### Todo
I need to port the new BasylPseudoAdaptor functionality from the C# variant over. This shouldn't be too difficult.
